# Ayla Mobile Foundry
### Codename: Sepia
#### Common Files (common_sepia)

Ayla Mobile Foundry (AMF) is a cross-platform framework for Android and iOS that allows developers to quickly create Ayla IoT mobile applications with very little effort.

Ayla Mobile Foundry includes a large set of features that may be used by the application. Depending on the desired type of application, developers choose which features to include as well as how the user interface is structured through the AMF configuration file, shared between both iOS and Android.

While AMF includes many highly-customizable user interface elements, it is not limited to only using these. AMF also allows developers to create their own user interface screens and controls that can be referenced from within the configuration file. Sepia components were designed to be extended, so developers are free to add functionality to the application without needing to make modifications to the Sepia framework.

## Get Started

The get started developing an Ayla Mobile Foundry (Sepia) based application, please follow the instructions and documentation at the main Ayla Mobile Foundry app (SepiaApp) repositories for [iOS](https://github.com/AylaNetworks/iOS_SepiaApp_Public) or [Android](https://github.com/AylaNetworks/Android_SepiaApp_Public) as required.

## Additional Information

The configuration file is documented [here](doc/sepia_config.md). The /doc folder contains many developer focused documents to aid in understanding and quickly coming up to speed with AMF.

#### Assets

The [Common Sepia Assets](https://github.com/AylaNetworks/common_sepia_assets_Public/) repo houses the Ayla Mobile UI Design Kit, associated documents and color specifications.
